Great, thanks for laying this out so clearly üëå. Since you‚Äôre focusing on the **Alumni part** for now, let‚Äôs refine your proposed **data model design** before jumping into code. I‚Äôll suggest a structure that balances simplicity, normalization, and future scalability.

---

## üèó Alumni Data Model Design

### 1. **Alumni (Abstract Base)**

* Represents common fields for **all alumni**.
* Holds identity, registration, verification, and status info.
* We should avoid inheritance via separate tables for `EmployedAlumni` and `UnEmployedAlumni` ‚Äî instead, a **single `Alumni` entity with a discriminator (employmentStatus)** is better. Inheritance in JPA can complicate queries and relationships.

```java
@Entity
@Table(name = "alumni")
public class Alumni {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;

    private String fullName;
    private String email;
    private String password; // hashed
    private String secretKey; // for verification at signup
    private Boolean verified = false;

    @Enumerated(EnumType.STRING)
    private EmploymentStatus employmentStatus; 
    // EMPLOYED / UNEMPLOYED

    @ManyToOne
    private College college;

    @OneToOne(mappedBy = "alumni", cascade = CascadeType.ALL)
    private SkillSet skillSet;

    @OneToOne(mappedBy = "alumni", cascade = CascadeType.ALL)
    private Job currentJob;  // only for EMPLOYED

    // timestamps: createdAt, updatedAt
}
```

---

### 2. **SkillSet**

* Holds career-related metadata.
* One-to-one with alumni (unemployed alumni will rely heavily on this).

```java
@Entity
@Table(name = "skill_set")
public class SkillSet {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;

    private String skills;          // comma-separated or normalized to Skill table
    private String certifications;  // list or JSON string
    private String projects;
    private String publications;
    private Double gpa;
    private Integer experienceYears;

    private Integer score; // auto-calculated in constructor/service
                          // based on GPA, skills, certifications, exp

    @OneToOne
    @JoinColumn(name = "alumni_id")
    private Alumni alumni;
}
```

---

### 3. **Job (Current Employment of Alumni)**

* One-to-one with employed alumni.

```java
@Entity
@Table(name = "job")
public class Job {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;

    private String role;
    private String company;
    private Double salary;
    private String location;
    private String workingHours; 
    private String workingDays;

    @OneToOne
    @JoinColumn(name = "alumni_id")
    private Alumni alumni;
}
```

---

### 4. **NewJob (Job Opportunities)**

* Jobs posted by **college** or **employed alumni**.
* Linked back to the poster type.

```java
@Entity
@Table(name = "new_job")
public class NewJob {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;

    private String role;
    private String company;
    private Double salary;
    private String workingHours;
    private String workingDays;
    private String requiredSkills;

    @Enumerated(EnumType.STRING)
    private PosterType postedByType; // COLLEGE / ALUMNI

    private String contactEmail;
    private String applicationUrl;

    @ManyToOne
    private Alumni postedByAlumni; // null if posted by college

    @ManyToOne
    private College postedByCollege; // null if posted by alumni
}
```

---

### 5. **College & PlacementOfficer**

(Handled by your teammate, but linking here for clarity.)

```java
@Entity
@Table(name = "college")
public class College {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;

    private String name;
    private String address;
    private String contactMail;

    @OneToOne(mappedBy = "college", cascade = CascadeType.ALL)
    private PlacementOfficer placementOfficer;
}
```

```java
@Entity
@Table(name = "placement_officer")
public class PlacementOfficer {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;

    private String username;
    private String password; // hashed

    @OneToOne
    @JoinColumn(name = "college_id")
    private College college;
}
```

---

## üîë Why This Design?

1. **Avoids inheritance pitfalls** ‚Äî all alumni are in one table, differentiated by `employmentStatus`.
2. **Extensible** ‚Äî you can later add relationships (alumni ‚Üí referrals, alumni ‚Üí applications).
3. **Skill evaluation logic** can live in a `SkillService` that computes the `score` automatically when a `SkillSet` is created/updated.
4. **NewJob flexibility** ‚Äî works for both alumni and college posters.
